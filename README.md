📄 PDF Text Extractor (Python Automation)

A simple and efficient Python script that extracts text from any PDF file using PyPDF2.
This project is part of my AI Engineer Automation Roadmap, where I build small tools that automate repetitive tasks.

🚀 What this project does

✔ Reads any PDF file
✔ Extracts all the text
✔ Saves the extracted text into a .txt file
✔ Works for multi-page PDFs
✔ Created as part of learning automation, Python scripting, and AI workflows

🧠 Why I built this

I want to automate small everyday tasks so I can focus more on learning AI/ML, Automation, and Agentic AI.
Extracting text from PDFs manually is slow — so I built a tool that does it instantly.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python
PyPDF2
File handling
Automation scripting
